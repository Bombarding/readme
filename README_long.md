> Tips

- HAVE WHITE SPACE
- MAKE IT PRETTY
- GIFS ARE REALLY COOL

### GIF Tools

- Use [Recordit](http://recordit.co/) to create quicks screencasts of your desktop and export them as `GIF`s.
- For terminal sessions, there's [ttystudio](https://github.com/chjj/ttystudio) which also supports exporting `GIF`s.
